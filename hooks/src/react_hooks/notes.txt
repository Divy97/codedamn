UseRef :-

returns mutable object and has only one property known as .current 
never ever re-renders the DOM ELEMENT 

UseReducer :- 

is also used to manage state and re-render component when state change 
useReducer Hook takes 2 arguments: reducerFunction, initialValue
generally you pass object as an initialValue in useReducer Hook.

STATE, DISPATCH, ACTION, ACTION_TYPE 
function reducerFunction(state, action) {
    return {
        count: state.count + 1;
    }
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunction, {count: 0});

dispatch is function basically used to update state
